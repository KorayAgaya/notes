LM
=====
LM-hashes is the oldest password storage used by Windows, dating back to OS/2 in the 1980’s. 
Due to the limited charset allowed, they are fairly easy to crack. You can obtain them, if still available, 
from the SAM database on a Windows system, or the NTDS database on the Domain Controller.

LM was turned off by default starting in Windows Vista/Server 2008, 
but might still linger in a network if there older systems are still used. 
It is possible to enable it in later versions through a GPO setting (even Windows 2016/10).

When dumping the SAM/NTDS database, they are shown together with the NTHash, before the colon.

hashcat -m 3000 -a 3 hash.txt

Example

299BD128C1101FD6

The algorithm

1. Convert all lower case to upper case
2. Pad password to 14 characters with NULL characters
3. Split the password to two 7 character chunks
4. Create two DES keys from each 7 character chunk
5. DES encrypt the string "KGS!@#$%" with these two chunks
6. Concatenate the two DES encrypted strings. This is the LM hash.


NTHash (A.K.A. NTLM)
========================
This is the way passwords are stored on modern Windows systems, and can be obtained by dumping the SAM database, 
or using Mimikatz. They are also stored on domain controllers in the NTDS file. 
These are the hashes you can use to pass-the-hash.

Usually people call this the NTLM hash (or just NTLM), which is misleading, 
as Microsoft refers to this as the NTHash (at least in some places). 
I personally recommend to call it the NTHash, to try to avoid confusion.

john --format=nt hash.txt
hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 hash.txt

Example

The algorithm

MD4(UTF-16-LE(password))


NTLMv1 (A.K.A. Net-NTLMv1)
==============================
The NTLM protocol uses the NTHash in a challenge/response between a server and a client. The v1 of the protocol uses both the NT and LM hash, 
depending on configuration and what is available. The Wikipedia page on NT Lan Manager has a good explanation.

A way of obtaining a response to crack from a client, Responder is a great tool. 
The value to crack would be the K1 | K2 | K3 from the algorithm below. Version 1 is deprecated, 
but might still be used in some old systems on the network.

john --format=netntlm hash.txt
hashcat -m 5500 -a 3 hash.txt

Example

u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c

The algorithm

C = 8-byte server challenge, random
K1 | K2 | K3 = LM/NT-hash | 5-bytes-0
response = DES(K1,C) | DES(K2,C) | DES(K3,C)


NTLMv2 (A.K.A. Net-NTLMv2)
===========================
This is the new and improved version of the NTLM protocol, which makes it a bit harder to crack. 
The concept is the same as NTLMv1, only different algorithm and responses sent to the server. 
Also captured through Responder or similar. Default in Windows since Windows 2000.


john --format=netntlmv2 hash.txt
hashcat -m 5600 -a 3 hash.txt

Example

admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030

The algorithm

SC = 8-byte server challenge, random
CC = 8-byte client challenge, random
CC* = (X, time, CC2, domain name)
v2-Hash = HMAC-MD5(NT-Hash, user name, domain name)
LMv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC)
NTv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC*)
response = LMv2 | CC | NTv2 | CC*
